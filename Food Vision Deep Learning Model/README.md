This model was trained on the Food 101 TensorFlow Dataset that consists of 75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images.

It achieved a 80.4% top-1 accuracy, which beats [DeepFood](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304163308_DeepFood_Deep_Learning-Based_Food_Image_Recognition_for_Computer-Aided_Dietary_Assessment), a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.
