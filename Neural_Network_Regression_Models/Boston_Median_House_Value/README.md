 # The Boston house-price data of Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.   Used in Belsley, Kuh & Welsch, 'Regression diagnostics ...', Wiley, 1980.   N.B. Various transformations are used in the table on pages 244-261 of the latter.

 ## This is a dataset taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. It is publically available at http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston

<br>

 ## **Training variables in order:**
 - CRIM     per capita crime rate by town
 - ZN       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
 - INDUS    proportion of non-retail business acres per town
 - CHAS     Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
 - NOX      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
 - RM       average number of rooms per dwelling
 - AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
 - DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
 - RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways
 - TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
 
 - PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
 - B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
 - LSTAT    % lower status of the population


 ## **Testing variable that the model predicts**
 - MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
