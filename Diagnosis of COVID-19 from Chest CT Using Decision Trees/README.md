# Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest CT Using Decision Trees
## Authors: Katie Albert and Matt Boraske

The progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted advancements in machine learning applications in medicine, particularly for disease detection and diagnosis. While many state-of-the-art approaches achieve high levels of accuracy, they fall short in their interpretability. Because model interpretability is critical for effective human-automation interaction, we sought to demonstrate that comparable levels of accuracy could be achieved by a more interpretable approach. To do this, we designed a decision tree model that classified chest CT images for the presence of COVID-19 related infection. This model achieved almost 80% accuracy, demonstrating that moderate accuracy levels in COVID-19 diagnosis are feasible with a relatively simple and highly interpretable model.
